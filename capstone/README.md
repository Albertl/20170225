# Capstone project - 1

1. Create a directory named `capstone_2017` and version control that directory using git

2. Create a subfolder called `data` inside that directory

3. Download the [gapminder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upendrak/advance_R/master/data/gapminder.csv) dataset using your favorite linux commands into `data` subfolder

4. Subset the gapminder dataset into two files (any 2 years per file) using `grep` and write them to those two files respectively.

5. Create a function in Python that plots year on the x-axis and lifeExp on the y-axis for a particular country in Juypter notebook

6. Use that function on the two files as input

7. Commit all the files and folder, the data folder (contains the original csv along with two subsetted files) along with Jupyter notebook

8. Use `git` to push your changes to your remote repo on github

# Captstone project - 2 (If time permits)

1. Subset the gapminder dataset this time for three countries - `Uganda, USA and Canada`

2. Plot year vs GDP for those three countries: Write a python function and then use that function to plot for the three countries

3. Write your observations for those three plots. For example, has the GDP increased or decreased over the years for those three countries

4. Version control these files too and push them into the same `capstone_2017` remote repo on github
