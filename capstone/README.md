# Capstone Project 1 - Data in Pandas

1. Create a directory named `capstone_2017` and version control that directory using git

2. Create a subfolder called `data` inside that directory

3. Download the [gapminder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upendrak/advance_R/master/data/gapminder.csv) dataset using your favorite linux commands into `data` subfolder

4. Create a function in Python that plots year on the x-axis and lifeExp on the y-axis for a particular country in a Juypter notebook

5. Commit all the files and folder, the data folder, and the Jupyter notebook

6. Use `git` to push your changes to your remote repo on github

7. Adjust the function to compare n contries provided as a list

_Hint: unique is a common function to get the values of a list_

## What are some interesting points in gdpPercap, lifeExp, and pop?

8. Which country and what year had the largest gdpPercap?

9. Which country and what year had the lowest lifeExp?

10. Which country and what year had the greatest pop? Second largest Country?

11. For the year 2007, calculate the mean, min, and max life expectancies for each continent.

12. Make 2 histograms of global life expectancy. One with the default bin widths and one with narrower bin widths.
