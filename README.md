The Python lessons include Jupyter Notebooks.  
We use Anaconda3 in the workshops. 

Steps to use:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Anaconda3
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.  (On Windows I highly recommend ConEmu)
4. Start Anaconda3 with the command -- conda
5. Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook in python lessons/Fundamentals
6. Start the notebook with the command -- jupyter notebook
